# Kira-Tetris
This project is about making pretty pictures with a valid sequence of Tetris blocks.

## Specification
The program must create a grid of legal Tetris blocks and empty space. All pieces must be legally placed.
Modifiable parameters:
- The height and width of the image in blocks
- The px size of each block
- The height difference between the lowest and highest point on the board
- How "chaotic" the board is, from a scale of 0 to 100. The more chaotic, the more holes

See https://github.com/james27558/Kira-Tetris/wiki/Instructions-for-use---Command-Line-Arguments for instructions on how to use the provided jar
